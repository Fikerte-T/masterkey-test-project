# Test Project
This project is a web application for an imaginary web tutor. It includes a landing page and authentication pages. The landing page includes a Header, Hero section, and Footer. Authenticatio pages (sign in and log in pages) have basic form validations. When the app runs, the user first sees the landing page. From there, user can signup or log in. After successful login or signup, app redirects to a welcome page. LocalStorage is used to store and retrieve user data.
